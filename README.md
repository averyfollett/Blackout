# Game Description

**Blackout** is a Two-Player Co-Op game where players take the role of an arctic researcher trying to restore power to the Fawl-T Research Station. Both players must work together to navigate around the base and activate machines by connecting them to a handheld generator. Will you be able to fix the issues, or will the base be stuck without power? Itâ€™s up to you to decide.
